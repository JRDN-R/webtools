Prompt Construction: We create a system message that instructs the assistant to be witty and sarcastic, in the style of Nate Bargatze and Shane Gillis. We ensure the assistant addresses people by name and uses humor. If we retrieved contextual info about the family, we append that to the system message as Relevant context: .... If GPT-2 provided any useful prompt addition, we include that as a background hint (this could help guide o3's response style or content). Then the user's message (the actual text from the group chat) is added as the user role content.
