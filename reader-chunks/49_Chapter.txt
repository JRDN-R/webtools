Cloudflare Tunnel removes the need to deploy the server on an external host â€” you can run it locally and still have it accessible. If you prefer not to run a local server at all times, you could deploy the above Flask app to a cloud host or use a service like Google Cloud Run or Heroku (ensuring WebSocket support is enabled). But in our scenario, using the tunnel is convenient and secure (no open ports, and you can add Cloudflare Access policies if needed for authentication).
