OpenAI API Call: We call openai.ChatCompletion.create with the o3.5-turbo model (you can use text-davinci-003 or others, but the ChatCompletion with o3.5/4 is suited for conversational replies). We pass the messages array, set a temperature for creativity, and limit max_tokens for the response length. The system will then generate a completion. If the API call succeeds, we extract the reply text. In our scenario, the reply will likely already contain the humorous tone and possibly address the sender by name (since we asked it to do so in the prompt).
