GPT-2 Processing: (Optional) We pass the user text to the GPT-2 pipeline to generate some additional context or a prompt continuation. This is optional and experimental â€“ one might use it to guess the user's intent or add a witty intermediate phrase. In practice, GPT-2 may not be very coherent for long texts, so this could be replaced or fine-tuned. (If it fails or isn't needed, we handle exceptions and proceed with no addition.)
