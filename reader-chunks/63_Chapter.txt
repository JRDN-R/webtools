Choosing the Best Framework: You asked which framework is best for this setup. In our solution, we used Flask for demonstration. Flask with Flask-SocketIO works, but for heavy asynchronous communication and scale, FastAPI (with its native WebSocket support and async capabilities) could be a better choice. FastAPI would allow an async def websocket_endpoint() that can await the OpenAI API call without blocking other connections. If sticking with Flask, using eventlet or gevent (as Flask-SocketIO does under the hood) is fine for a small-scale project. For orchestrating the AI pipeline (combining local models, vector search, and remote API), a framework like LangChain can be very helpful. LangChain provides abstractions to manage multi-step AI workflows, including calling Hugging Face models locally and the OpenAI API, and doing retrieval from vector stores, all in a coherent chain. Our manual implementation could be refactored using LangChain's primitives (e.g., a retrieval QA chain with a vector store, or using a HuggingFace LLM class) to simplify the code. This isn't required, but it's an option if you expand the project. The concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) we used is well-supported by such frameworks
