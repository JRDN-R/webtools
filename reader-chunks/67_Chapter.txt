We have set up a comprehensive system where a browser extension listens to a Google Voice chat and triggers an AI response pipeline. The pipeline uses a local DistilGPT2 model for quick prompt brainstorming and a vector database of family info for context, then leverages OpenAI's o3.5 to craft a humorous response with the desired style. The response is sent back and posted in the chat, all in real-time.
