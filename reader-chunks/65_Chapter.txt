If deploying on Google Cloud, you might consider Cloud Run or Cloud Functions for the Python service (though Cloud Functions may not support persistent WebSocket, Cloud Run does). You would still need a way to get messages from Google Voice. Since Google Voice has no direct API, the browser extension approach (or an automated headless browser) is the way to go. Alternatively, other SMS services (Twilio, etc.) provide webhooks that could eliminate the need for an extension entirely, but that means using a different phone number. Given the requirement to use your actual Google Voice number in the family chat, our extension+websocket approach is a viable workaround.
