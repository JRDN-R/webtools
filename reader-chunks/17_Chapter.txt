Next, we set up the backend server that will handle incoming WebSocket messages from the extension, process them through our AI pipeline, and send back responses. We can use Python Flask with the Flask-SocketIO extension, or FastAPI (with Starlette websockets). In this guide, we'll demonstrate using Flask with Flask-SocketIO for simplicity. (You can choose FastAPI for an async approach as well; the overall logic is similar.)
